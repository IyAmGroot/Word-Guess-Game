# Word-Guess-Game

Hello TAs,

I spoke to Trey about taking a few liberties with the assignment, he approved them.

1.  Start the game by clicking a button instead of hitting any key.  Reason:  I play the college fight song when you guess the nickname.  It can go on for a bit so it makes more sense to have a button start the game.  You can click the button in while the song is playing to stop the music and start a new game.

2.  Number of guesses remaining.  I'm not using a number.  I start with 4 footballs.  For each missed guess, a football disappears.  No footballs = You lose.  You'll know it.

Thanks!
Eric
